# LutherieLab
A collection of modular browser-based tools for guitar physics, acoustics, and design.

Each tool is a self-contained experiment — no build system, no shared monolith.

## Structure
- `/common/` — lightweight shared helpers (optional)
- `/tools/` — self-contained applications
- `/assets/` — logos, fonts, and static media

## Getting Started
Open any tool’s `index.html` in a browser.
